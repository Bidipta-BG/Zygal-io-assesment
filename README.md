To start the server, you can navigate to API directory and in terminal first type 'npm i' and then 'npm start'.
To start the frontend user interface, navigate to UI directory and in terminal first type 'npm i' and then 'npm start'.

I have used React in the Frontend and Bootstrap for User Interface.

In the backend NodeJS and Express is used.

And MongoDB is used as database for saving data.
